An admin should be able to sign up
    If they don’t already have an account, they should be able to sign up first.
    If they are an existing user, they should be able to sign in with their email and password.
    They should also be able to sign out if they'd like to.

Admins can create elections
    Signed-in admins should be able to see a list of elections they have created, and create a new one.
    When creating an election, it should be possible to give a name for the election.

Admins can create a ballot of questions in an election
    Admins should be able to create a ballot - a list of questions they'd like voters to vote on.
    Admins should be able to add multiple questions to the ballot.
    For each question, admins should be able to fill in a short title, and a longer description.
    For each question, it should be possible for the admin to add answer options; each of these answer options should be a short string.
    Admins should be able to update the question title, description, and answer options. 
    Admins should be able to delete questions and answer options, as long as there's at least one question in the ballot.

Admins can register voters
    Admins should be able to register voters in an election.
    When adding a voter, admins should enter a voter ID and a voter password.


//Working on this section
Admins can launch an election 
    • Admins should be able to launch an election; this makes it possible for registered voters to visit the public page of an election and cast their vote.
    • Before launching an election, the admin should be shown a preview of what the ballot looks like. Admins should be blocked from launching an election if there is something wrong with the ballot - for example, if not every question has at least two answer options.
    • Once an election is launched, it should not be possible for the administrator to edit the ballot of questions.
